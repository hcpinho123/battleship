 * Checks if the given position corresponds to a position occupied by a ship.
 * If a match is found, the corresponding index of the ship is returned. Otherwise, it returns `undefined`.

 * @function getShipAtPosition
 * @param {GameBoard} board - The current game board, which contains the ships for both players.
 * @param {Player} player - The player whose ships will be checked (either "player1" or "player2").
