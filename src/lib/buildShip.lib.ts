/**
 * Builds a new ship object based on the provided type and orientation.
 * The function creates a `Ship` with the correct number of spaces based on the ship's type, 
 * sets the initial orientation, and initializes the ship's positions and hit status.
 * The ship is marked as not yet placed on the board.
 *
 * @function buildShip
 * @param {ShipType} type - The type of the ship (e.g., CARRIER, BATTLESHIP). Determines the size of the ship.
 * @param {OrientationType} orientation - The orientation of the ship (HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL).
 * @returns {Ship} A new `Ship` object with the specified type, orientation, and initial properties.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example of building a Cruiser ship with a horizontal orientation
 * const newShip = buildShip(ShipType.CRUISER, OrientationType.HORIZONTAL);
 * console.log(newShip); 
 * // { placed: false, spaces: 3, type: "Cruiser", orientation: "Horizontal", positions: [], hits: [] }
